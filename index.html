      When we look at the sky, we see different kinds of natural bodies like the sun, the stars, the moon, and so on. The natural bodies in the sky are called <strong>Celestial bodies</strong> or <strong>heavenly bodies</strong>. They are part of our universe. The universe is a huge space which contains everything that exists. The celestial bodies that we see are just a small fraction of the bodies that exist in the universe. One of the reasons why we do not see more of them is that they are very, very far away.
      Scientists believe that the universe was born after a massive explosion called the <strong>"big bang"</strong>. A long time after the big bang, stars like our sun were formed. At that time, clouds of hot gases and particles revolved around the sun. Over time, many particles got stuck together to form large bodies. These bodies pulled in smaller objects near them by gravitational force. This made them larger still. These bodies finally became the <strong>planets</strong>.

      There are <em>trillions</em> of stars in the universe. They occur in groups called <strong>Galaxies</strong>. The gravitational force between stars keeps the stars of a galaxy together. Apart from stars, a galaxy may have other celestial bodies like <em>planets</em> and <em>moons</em>. So you can say that a galaxy is a group of stars and other celestial bodies bound together by gravitational force.
      The distribution of the stars in a galaxy can give it a shape such as spiral, ring or elliptical. Our sun is a part of a spiral galaxy called the <strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong>. This galaxy is named after the Milky Way. The Milky Way is a band of stars that we can see on a clear night. These stars are a part of our galaxy. The ancient Romans called this band of stars <em>Via Galactica</em>, or ‘<em>road of milk’</em>. That is how our galaxy got its name.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3 id="solar system">The Solar system</h3>
    <p>
      The sun is the brightest object in the sky. It is huge. It is about <em>333,000</em> times heavier than the earth, and you could fit more than a million earths inside it! Its great mass causes a large gravitational force. This keeps the sun, the planets, their moons and some other smaller bodies together as the sun’s family. The sun and all the bodies moving around it are together called the <strong>solar system</strong>. All the members of the solar system revolve around the sun in almost circular paths, or <strong>orbits</<strong>.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      Planets
    </h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/image/planetsPic.jpg"id="pic"><br><br>
      After the sun, the planets are the largest bodies in our solar system. Scientists define a planet as a round body that orbits the sun and which has pulled in all objects near its orbit. Remember that planets were formed when large bodies in space pulled in smaller bodies near it. This cleared the space around a planet’s orbit.
      There are eight planets in our solar system. In order of distance from the sun they are <strong>Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune</strong>. You can remember this order as <em>My Very Efficient Maid Just Served Us Noodles</em>.
      Apart from revolving around the sun, each planet rotates, or spins, about its axis. The time taken to complete a revolution around the sun is the length of a planets year. And the time taken to complete one rotation is the planets day.
      The four planets closest to the sun-Mercury,Venus,Earth and Mars-are small, rocky planets. They are called <strong>terrestrial</strong> (<em>earthlike</em>) planets. The other four planets Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus and Neptune are giants in comparison.
      They are made up mainly of gases. They are called gas giants or <em>Jovian</em> (<em>Jupiter like</em>) planets. All the gas giants have rings around them. Since they are very far from the sun, the gas giants are much colder than the terrestrial planets.
      While stars twinkle, planets shine with a steady light. You can see some of the planets with the naked eyes or with the help of a good pair of binoculars. Just remember that as the planets move around the sun, they appear at different positions in the sky at different times of the year. And for the period they are behind the sun, they are not visible.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3 id="asteroids">Asteroids</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/image/AsteroidPic.jpg"id="pic"><br><br>
      In a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, millions of small, irregular, rocky bodies revolve around the sun. These are <strong>asteroids</strong>, and the belt is known as the <em>asteroid belt</em>. Asteroids are also called <em>minor planets</em>.
      Scientists think that asteroids are pieces of material that failed to come together to form a planet when the solar system was being formed. Asteroids can measure a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in width. Some asteroids even have moons.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
    </p>
    <h3 id="meteroids">Meteoroids</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/image/meteroid-63125.jpg"id="pic"><br><br>
      Asteroids were not the only pieces of rock left over from the formation of the solar system. Some others, called <strong>Meteoroids</strong>, still orbit the sun. When they come very close to a planet such as the earth, gravitation pulls them in.
      As they enter the earths atmosphere, they heat up because of friction with the air, and start burning. As these burning meteoroids fall towards the ground, we see them as streaks of light. The streak of light caused by a burning meteoroid is called a <strong>Meteor</strong> or a <strong>shooting star</strong>.
      Fortunately, the material of most meteoroids burns up completely before it can reach the surface of the earth. However, some large ones fail to burn up completely and strike the earth’s surface. Meteoroids that fall on a planet or a moon are called <em>meteorites</em>. A large meteorite can create a large crater and cause a lot of damage.
      Scientists think that dinosaurs were wiped off the earth following a meteorite hit. Meteorite hits are more common on those planets and moons which have little or no atmosphere to burn off the falling rock. The craters on our moon have resulted from meteorite hits.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3 id="comets">Comets</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/image/cometsPic.jpg"id="pic"><br><br>
      A comet is a small body of ice and dust that moves around the sun in an elongated orbit. As a comet approaches the sun, it heats up and leaves behind a stream of hot, glowing gases and dust particles. We see this as the <em>'tail'</em> of the comet.
      Comets take many years to complete an orbit around the sun. For example, <em>Halleys Comet</em> takes 76 years to go around the sun. Some comets come from outside the solar system, and after going around the sun they go back, perhaps never to return again.<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      This are just but a few topics of the composition of the universe at large. Since the universe is so big there are still alot of research being done day and night to continue uncovering the mystery of the universe.
